We created a game on Unity based on the popular indie game Jump King. The goal of the game is to reach the top of the map without falling. Unlike traditional platformers, there is no health system or enemies. It is possible to fall while scaling up the map. Falling will cause you lose progress, requiring you to repeat floors. 

HOW TO BUILD
Since the game was created through a game engine, it does not require and an ide. Instead, we were able to build an executable file. In order to play our game, one only has to download the source file generated by Unity. Next, the must run the executable file called "Platformer2" which will run our game. 

HOW TO PLAY
There is no horizontal ground movement in this game. You can only move by jumping. Use A nd D to control the direction of your jump. How high you jump depends on how long you hold space for.
